layout: post
title:  "Usage Guide"
---

Use the guide to prepare good looking posts! The theme has a sidebar which uses 3d transitions. To change the contents of the sidebar, look inside **_includes** folder for ``sidebar.html`` file and edit it.


## CSS elements
Since the theme is based on bootstrap, you can use bootstrap classes. Take a look at [elements](/elements) page.

## Site name
By default the site name is **Webjeda Gatok**. Change it in ``_config.yml`` file by changing ``title: Webjeda Gatok``.

## Logo
I have designed the logo which suits for this site. You either use other logo or keep the original. I do not claim the copyrights :)
